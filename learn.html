                    <h2>1. Consume less.</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Curbing consumption can have a huge impact on the environment. The three "R's"—reduce, reuse and
                        recycle— get a lot of attention, but the planet could benefit from some focus on the most
                        important and most underrepresented "R": refuse.</p>
                    <p>When you refuse, you say "no," which is not always easy. Freebies at events, cheap goods on
                        clearance, the hot new children's toys or the latest gadgets that promise to make your life
                        better—none of these are essential. And they almost always end up either in the trash or
                        forgotten in the back of a closet. Next time you’re tempted to purchase or accept a
                        non-essential item, think about whether it would truly improve your life. If not, it's ok to
                        just say, "No, thanks!"</p>
                    <p><span style="color: #f47825;">Bonus:</span> Refusing to allow unneeded items into your life can
                        save you money and reduce the amount of clutter in your home.</p>

                    <h2>2. Compost.</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Another “R” that doesn’t get much attention but has important environmental implications is
                        “rot.” As in, let your food and yard waste rot naturally in the soil instead of sending it to
                        the landfill. In other words: compost.</p>
                    <p>Composting your food scraps and yard waste offers double rewards: it keeps an incredible amount
                        of trash out of the waste stream, and it produces free, rich soil to use in your garden. Some
                        cities now pick up organic waste alongside regular trash and recycling pick up. If your area
                        doesn’t offer this service, no worries— you can set up a low-maintenance compost pile in your
                        backyard.</p>

                    <h2>3. Choose reusable over single-use.</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Think about how many people you see each day drinking beverages from disposable cups or
                        disposable bottles, sipping from disposable straws, carrying disposable grocery bags, eating
                        from disposable plates or containers and using disposable utensils. All that single-use plastic
                        has to go somewhere, and it’s had a devastating effect on our soil, oceans and marine life.</p>
                    <p>All of the above items (and more) have more environmentally responsible counterparts. Switch to
                        reusable items and make a commitment to use them as often as possible. You’ll have less trash
                        piling up at your curb, and you’ll be helping to protect the environment in a major way.</p>

                    <h2>4. Upcycle more.</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Get creative with your useless or unwanted items by upcycling—basically, turning trash into
                        treasure. Creating something new such as artwork, toys or jewelry is both satisfying and one of
                        the best ways to protect the environment. Not only does it keep items out of the trash, it can
                        prevent having to purchase new items, which require lots of resources to produce. Children love
                        making things; so instead of heading to the craft store, check out your recycle bin first and
                        let their imaginations soar!</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>If you can’t refuse it…and you can’t rot it…and you can’t reduce it…and you can’t upcycle or
                        reuse it…then it’s time to turn to the final “R”—recycling. Educate yourself on what can and
                        cannot be recycled in your bins at home. Throwing the wrong items in the recycle bin can result
                        in an entire load being rejected, which means … back to the landfill.</p>
                    <p>You can also easily find out how to recycle special items such as electronics, batteries and
                        appliances. Check with your local municipality for drop-off sites, and make an effort to get
                        your items to the proper disposal sites.</p>

                    <p>Did you know it takes over 700 gallons of water to grow enough cotton to make just one plain
                        t-shirt?</p>
                    <p>Instead of heading to the mall to buy new clothes, consider looking first in a thrift store or
                        vintage shop, or trading clothes with friends. You can breathe new life into your wardrobe
                        without wasting the precious resources needed to produce new clothing.</p>
                    <p>Shopping secondhand also applies for many other categories of consumer goods: children’s games

                    <p>While we’re on the topic of shopping, it’s important to think about the path your stuff takes
                        just to get to you. All that packaging, combined with the fuel needed for delivery, really takes
                        a toll on the environment. Instead, check out your local farmers market for fresh, package-free
                        food; try eating at a farm-to-table restaurant; and buy from local artists, clothing makers, and
                        retailers before you click for that two-day shipping.</p>

                        It’s hard to be sure about the long-term negative effects chemicals can have, both on our bodies
                        and on the planet, so it’s best to avoid them if possible. Opt for chemical-free lawn and garden
                        care; all-natural beauty and hygiene items; natural household cleaners; and organic food. The
                        Earth will thank you!</p>

                        about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.<sup>1</sup> Any amount of that we can cut back
                        on will help. For short trips, try walking or biking—you’ll also get a healthy dose of exercise
                        in, without setting foot in a gym. If travelling on foot or two wheels isn’t feasible, try
                        carpooling with a friend, neighbor or coworker to a mutual destination. And if all else fails
                        and you need to drive your car, line up errands in the most efficient route to save time and

                        times you consume water, both inside and outside your home; then, make adjustments as you can.
                        For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Turn off the tap while you brush your teeth.</li>
                        <li>Fix leaky faucets.</li>
                        <li>Make your water use more efficient by aerating faucets, using sprinklers that reduce runoff
                            and installing low-flow toilets and efficient shower heads.</li>
                        <li>Collect and use rainwater for watering plants.</li>
                        <li>Shorten your shower by a few minutes—or skip it altogether if you don't really need one that
                            day.</li>
                        <li>Only run your dishwasher or washing machine when it's full</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These are just the basics—you can get really creative when it comes to conserving water.</p>
